Pro-Russian users have often repeated the Kremlin's original position that the invasion of Ukraine is a "special military operation" to "degasify" and "demilitarise" a "Neo-Nazi state". Many have downplayed allegations of Russian war crimes or even claimed that the war is a supposed "hoax". In one widely shared video, a news reporter could be seen standing in front of lines of body bags, one of which was moving. However, the footage did not show invented war casualties in Ukraine, but a "Fridays for Future" climate change protest in Vienna in February, three weeks before the invasion began. Days later, another viral video of a mannequin claimed to be proof that Ukrainian authorities had "staged" t he mass killing of civilians in the town of Buchan. The misleading clip showed a prosthetic doll bein g dressed and prepared by two men. Nadezhda, an assistant director for a Russian television programme, confirmed to Euro news that the video showed their film set near St. Petersburg and not Ukrainian military personnel. "The information being given [to Russian citizens] is one-sided, it has nothing t o do with reality, it is as badly done as any fake," she told Euro news. Euro news The mannequin was being prepared for a television scene in Vetoless in Russia's Leningrad region. Euro news Other examples of Ukraine war misinformation have centred on "crisis actors" people who are supposedly hired t o act out the role of terrified or deceased war victims. One false claim suggested that a well-known beauty blogger had "acted" as the pregnant victim of a deadly attack on a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol on 9 March. Russia has shifted its stance on the attack, accusing Ukrainian Azov nationalists of staging a "hoax" bombing at a "non-operational" hospital. Its unfounded claims were late r removed by both Facebook and Twitter.
